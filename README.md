## Build

To initialize the project, run the following command:

Since it is a library, it is not necessary to run the project. To make it a local module, run the following command:

```bash
npm link
```

Later, in the project that uses the library, run the following command:

```bash
npm link qvog-lib
```

## Development

For better code style, we have ESLint set up. To run the linter, run the following command to check and fix the code:

```bash
npm run lint
